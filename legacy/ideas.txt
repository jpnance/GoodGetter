define practiceable things
start an attempt on one
attempt either fails with no time or succeeds with a time

warm-ups are a combination of hard levels and fun levels
hard levels are probably those with high failure rates
fun levels are probably those with high success rates
levels should be able to be starred so they're often included in the warm-up routine


￼<11:33:40> "jpnance": maybe a strange question but when you guys are practicing, how do you tend to decide what to practice?
￼<11:34:49> "jpnance": is it more about practicing new strats that save the most time? more about practicing things you're inconsistent at? more about practicing things that have tripped you up recently?
￼<11:35:07> "#1 Arne Fangurl": all of those
￼<11:35:23> "jpnance": i'm dicking around with a little webapp that helps guide my practice sessions so i'm looking for input for what others might want out of it
￼<11:37:53> "jpnance": like others, i imagine, i sometimes get too much into the habit of practicing shit because it's fun or because i'm already good at it
￼<11:38:39> "jpnance": so it's kind of nice for The Data to say, "no, dummy, you're already fine at 2-5. go practice 4-4."
￼<11:45:10> "#1 Arne Fangurl": yeah i agree
￼<11:45:22> "#1 Arne Fangurl": i pretty much only practice rockless lol
￼<12:06:29> "Crispy": I would take notes on what I missed in runs and practice those
￼<12:06:47> "Crispy": as well as levels i deemed "hard"
￼<12:06:56> "Crispy": such as 6-1 - 6-4
￼<12:07:23> "Crispy": there were more but i had some levels i focused on
￼<12:07:31> "Crispy": I tried to focus on late game
￼<12:07:42> "Crispy": bc it's way more important
￼<12:08:15> "jpnance": yeah, i think late game practice is pretty common for people who are trying to improve a pretty hardened time and end up resetting a lot early
￼<12:09:31> "Crispy": honestly, in warpless I was so consistent in w1-w3 towards the end I wouldn't reset before then very often
￼<12:10:05> "Crispy": but that was just experience and bc i reset previously so often
￼<12:10:55> "Crispy": being able to get multiple sub 28￼5 w2s in a row was cool
￼<12:11:00> "Crispy": too bad the game sucked
￼<12:13:23> "jpnance": what about for warm-ups? any rhyme or reason to what you guys decide to warm up with?
￼<12:13:50> "jpnance": i personally have a few levels that i want to make sure i warm up with just so a real run isn't the first time i see it that night
￼<12:14:05> "jpnance": 5-7 is one, for example
￼<12:15:19> "Crispy": 6-1 - 6-4
￼<12:15:22> "Crispy": rockless
￼<12:15:30> "Crispy": 5-7 5-3
￼<12:15:31> "jpnance": yeah, the aforementioned "hard" levels
￼<12:15:38> "Crispy": yea
￼<12:16:21> "jpnance": it's probably more art than science but what defines a "hard" level to you?
￼<12:18:03> "Crispy": generally just levels that I have had a history of having problems with
￼<12:18:15> "Crispy": also if i find them fun i warm up with them
￼<12:18:21> "Crispy": or if they are high input
￼<12:18:31> "jpnance": gotcha
￼<12:18:35> "Crispy": like 2-5 is easy imo
￼<12:18:39> "jpnance": yeah like 2-5 is a level i find fun and don't struggle much with
￼<12:18:40> "Crispy": but i warm up with it
￼<12:18:40> "jpnance": yeah haha
￼<12:18:50> "Crispy": lol
￼<12:19:07> "jpnance": funny to think about, too, because 2-5 was among the tougher levels for me to learn when i was just starting out
￼<12:19:26> "Crispy": yea it's hard for newer players bc so much is going on
￼<12:19:37> "Crispy": but the windows for everything are pretty big
￼<12:19:50> "Crispy": it's also good practice for movement
￼<12:19:54> "Crispy": the first screen
￼<12:19:55> "jpnance": yeah for sure
￼<12:20:04> "jpnance": lots of left-right jumps
￼<12:20:08> "Crispy": making sure you don't rub them walls
￼<12:20:33> "Crispy": i mean if you do the optimized strats you do 0 left-right jumps
￼<12:20:36> "Crispy": but noone does that
￼<12:20:39> "jpnance": right
￼<12:20:40> "Crispy": bc really dumb
￼<12:20:44> "Crispy": lol
￼<12:21:05> "Crispy": that shell bounce is really stupid
￼<12:21:28> "Crispy": i don't even do it in hundo
